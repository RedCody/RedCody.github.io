My Code Louisville project deals with my pet Chihuahua Cody. This website deals with him being a therapy dog. This site will talk about what therapy dogs do. It also interacts with the viewer asking for input from the viewer and or potential patient. It will also adjust text and delete the bottom photo depending on the size of the viewer the user is using in order to help them read the text better.
